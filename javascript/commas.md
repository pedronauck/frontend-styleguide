## Commas

- Leading commas: **Nope.**

```javascript
// bad
var once
  , upon
  , aTime;

// good
var once,
    upon,
    aTime;

// bad
var hero = {
    firstName: 'Bob'
  , lastName: 'Parr'
  , heroName: 'Mr. Incredible'
  , superPower: 'strength'
};

// good
var hero = {
  firstName: 'Bob',
  lastName: 'Parr',
  heroName: 'Mr. Incredible',
  superPower: 'strength'
};
```

- Additional trailing comma: **Nope.** This can cause problems with IE6/7 and IE9 if it's in quirksmode. Also, in some implementations of ES3 would add length to an array if it had an additional trailing comma. This was clarified in ES5 ([source](http://es5.github.io/#D)):

> Edition 5 clarifies the fact that a trailing comma at the end of an ArrayInitialiser does not add to the length of the array. This is not a semantic change from Edition 3 but some implementations may have previously misinterpreted this.

```javascript
// bad
var hero = {
  firstName: 'Kevin',
  lastName: 'Flynn',
};

var heroes = [
  'Batman',
  'Superman',
];

// good
var hero = {
  firstName: 'Kevin',
  lastName: 'Flynn'
};

var heroes = [
  'Batman',
  'Superman'
];
```
